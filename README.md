## Description

Inventory is bare-bones, fully tested inventory solution. It provides the basics of inventory management such as:

- Inventory item management
- Inventory stock management
- Inventory stock movement tracking
- Inventory SKU generation
- Inventory supplier management
- Inventory transaction management

All movements, stocks and inventory items are automatically given the current logged in user's ID. All inventory actions
such as puts/removes/creations are covered by Laravel's built in database transactions. If any exception occurs
during a inventory change, it will be rolled back automatically.

Depending on your needs, you may use the built in traits for customizing and creating your own models, or
you can simply use the built in models.

## Requirements

- Laravel 4.* | 5.*
- Laravel's Auth, Sentry or Sentinel if you need automatic accountability

Recommended:

- Venturecraft/Revisionable (For tracking Category and Location changes to stocks)

## Benefits

If you're using the traits from this package to customize your install, that means you have complete flexibility over your own
models, methods (excluding relationship names/type), database tables, property names, and attributes. You can set your
own base model, and if you don't like the way a method is performed just override it.

Sit back and relax, it's nice to have control.

## Installation (Laravel 4)

Add inventory to your `composer.json` file:

    "stevebauman/inventory" : "1.3.*"

Now perform a `composer update` on your project's source.

Then insert the service provider in your `app/config/app.php` config file:

    'Stevebauman\Inventory\InventoryServiceProvider'

If you want to customize the database tables, you can publish the migration and run it yourself:

    php artisan migrate:publish stevebauman/inventory

And then run the migration:

    php artisan migrate
    
Otherwise you can run the install command:

    php artisan inventory:install
    
Be sure to publish the configuration if you'd like to customize inventory:
    
    php artisan config:publish stevebauman/inventory
    
## Installation (Laravel 5)

Include in your `composer.json` file:

    "stevebauman/inventory" : "1.3.*"

Now perform a `composer update` on your project's source.

Then insert the service provider in your `config/app.php` config file:

    'Stevebauman\Inventory\InventoryServiceProvider'
    
Either publish the assets to customize the database tables using:

    php artisan vendor:publish
   
And then run the migrations:

    php artisan migrate
    
Or use the inventory install command:

    php artisan inventory:install

## Updates

### Updating from 1.0.* to 1.1.*

1.1.* brings automatic SKU generation for better item management. This adds some new functions, traits, and a new database table.
<b>Nothing</b> has been removed.

You will need to republish the configuration files for any upgrade path to enable SKU generation.

Once you have run the migrations with one of the paths shown below, you will have to create the 
new `InventorySku` model shown in the <a href="#i-want-to-customize-my-models">I need to customize my models</a>
installation if you have created your own models.

Once you have done that, you will need to add the `sku()` relationship method on your `Inventory` model:

    public function sku()
    {
        return $this->hasOne('InventorySku', 'inventory_id', 'id');
    }
    
Now you're all set for the migrations.

#### I did not customize my migrations
If you have <b>not</b> modified the migrations and installed inventory from the supplied command, all you need to run is:

    php artisan inventory:run-migrations
    
This will run the new migration.

#### I customized my migrations
If you <b>have</b> modified the migrations and ran them yourself, you will have to republish the migrations using:

##### Laravel 4:

    php artisan migrate:publish --package="stevebauman/inventory"

##### Laravel 5:

    php artisan vendor:publish

Don't worry, laravel won't overwrite migrations that already exist, and then run:

    php artisan migrate
    
This will run the new available migration.

### Updating from 1.1.* to 1.2.*

1.2.* combines the the `prefix` and `code` column on the `inventory_skus` table. This allows for easier searching and
maintainability. <b>Nothing</b> has been removed besides the `prefix` column on the included migration.

A new configuration option named `sku_separator` is now included. This means you can now choose what separates the prefix
from the code. For example, a `sku_separator` with a hyphen (-) inserted, the SKU generated might look like this:

    DRI-00001

Due to the removal of the database column, all you should need to do is remove the `prefix` column from the `inventory_skus`
database table. However this means you'll need to regenerate all of your SKU's unfortunately. You can perform this by looping
through your inventory items and using the method `regenerateSku()`:

    $items = Inventory::all();
    
    foreach($items as $item)
    {
        $item->regenerateSku();
    }

### Updating from 1.2.* to 1.3.*

1.3.* brings inventory suppliers. This is a basic informational upgrade, meaning all this update brings is <em>more</em>
information to your inventory.

If you're using the prebuilt models, you won't have to do anything besides run the new migration using the command:

    php artisan inventory:run-migrations
    
However if you're using custom models, you will have to create a new model named `Supplier` with the information supplied
in the install process, as well as add the new relationship method to your Inventory model below:

    public function suppliers()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('Supplier', 'inventory_suppliers', 'inventory_id')->withTimestamps();
    }

If you're using custom migrations you will need to re-publish the inventory migrations using:

##### Laravel 4:

    php artisan migrate:publish --package="stevebauman/inventory"

##### Laravel 5:

    php artisan vendor:publish
   
Then run the migration using:

    php artisan migrate

### Upcoming Updates

`1.4.*` will bring Inventory Transactions. Transactions will allow you to reserve, hold, checkout, sell, order, and do many other
useful things easily with your inventory. Most importantly it will allow you to track the history of each transaction, and who
triggered it (if enabled). Upgrading will just be running or publishing another migration (depending on your setup), 
and you will need to add a couple of relationship methods on your current models.

`1.5.*` will bring Inventory Assemblies. More information coming on this when it's in development after `1.4.*`.

### I don't need to customize my models

If you don't need to create & customize your models, I've included pre-built models.

If you'd like to use them you'll have include them in your use statements:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Models\Inventory;
    
    class InventoryController extends BaseController
    {
        /*
        * Holds the inventory model
        *
        * @var Inventory
        */
        protected $inventory;
    
        public function __construct(Inventory $inventory)
        {
            $this->inventory = $inventory;
        }
        
        public function create()
        {
            $item = new $this->inventory;
            
            // etc...
        }
    }

### I want to customize my models

Create the models, but keep in mind the models need:

- The shown fillable attribute arrays
- The shown relationship names (such as `stocks()`)
- The shown relationship type (such as hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo etc)

You are free to modify anything else (such as table names, model names, namespace etc!).

Metric:

    class Metric extends Model
    {
        protected $table = 'metrics';
    }
    
Location:
    
    use Baum\Node;
    
    class Location extends Node 
    {
        protected $table = 'locations';
    }

Category:

    use Baum\Node;
    
    class Category extends Node
    {
        protected $table = 'categories';
    }

Supplier:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Traits\SupplierTrait;
    
    class Supplier extends BaseModel
    {
        use SupplierTrait;
    
        protected $table = 'suppliers';
        
         public function items()
        {
            return $this->belongsToMany('Inventory', 'inventory_suppliers', 'supplier_id')->withTimestamps();
        }
    }

Inventory:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Traits\InventoryTrait;
    
    class Inventory extends Model
    {
        use InventoryTrait;
    
        protected $table = 'inventory';
        
        public function category()
        {
            return $this->hasOne('Category', 'id', 'category_id');
        }
        
        public function metric()
        {
            return $this->hasOne('Metric', 'id', 'metric_id');
        }
        
        public function sku()
        {
            return $this->hasOne('InventorySku', 'inventory_id', 'id');
        }
        
        public function stocks()
        {
            return $this->hasMany('InventoryStock', 'inventory_id');
        }
        
        public function suppliers()
        {
            return $this->belongsToMany('Supplier', 'inventory_suppliers', 'inventory_id')->withTimestamps();
        }
    }
    
InventorySku:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Traits\InventorySkuTrait;
    
    class InventorySku extends Model
    {
        use InventorySkuTrait;
    
        protected $table = 'inventory_skus';
        
        protected $fillable = array(
            'inventory_id',
            'code',
        );
    }
    
InventoryStock:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Traits\InventoryStockTrait;
    
    class InventoryStock extends Model
    {
        use InventoryStockTrait;
    
        protected $table = 'inventory_stocks';
        
        protected $fillable = array(
            'inventory_id',
            'location_id',
            'quantity',
            'aisle',
            'row',
            'bin',
        );
    
        public function item()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('Inventory', 'inventory_id', 'id');
        }

        public function movements()
        {
            return $this->hasMany('InventoryStockMovement', 'stock_id');
        }
        
        public function location()
        {
            return $this->hasOne('Location', 'id', 'location_id');
        }
    }

InventoryStockMovement:

    use Stevebauman\Inventory\Traits\InventoryStockMovementTrait;
    
    class InventoryStockMovement extends Model
    {
        use InventoryStockMovementTrait;
        
        protected $table = 'inventory_stock_movements';
        
        protected $fillable = array(
            'stock_id',
            'user_id',
            'before',
            'after',
            'cost',
            'reason',
        );
        
        public function stock()
        {
            return $this->belongsTo('InventoryStock', 'stock_id', 'id');
        }
    }

## Usage

First you'll have to create a metric that your Inventory is measured by:

    $metric = new Metric;
    
    $metric->name = 'Litres';
    $metric->symbol = 'L';
    $metric->save();
    
Now, create a category to store the inventory record under:

    $category = new Category;
    
    $category->name = 'Drinks';
    $category->save();
    
Then, you'll create an inventory record, and assign the metric and category we just created:
    
    $item = new Inventory;
    
    $item->metric_id = $metric->id;
    $item->category_id = $category->id;
    $item->name = 'Milk';
    $item->description = 'Delicious milk';
    $item->save();
    
Now we have our inventory item created. We have to add stock, but to add stock we need to create a Location to bind the stock to:

    $location = new Location;
    
    $location->name = 'Warehouse';
    $location->save();
    
Now we can add stock to our inventory by supplying a number (int or string), and the location (Location object):
    
    /*
    * Creating a stock will automatically create a stock movement, no matter which method is used below.
    */
    
    $item->createStockOnLocation(20, $location);
    
    /*
    * Or we can create a stock manually.
    * If you want to set the cost and reason for the creation of the stock, be sure to do so
    */
    $stock = new InventoryStock;
    $stock->inventory_id = $item->id;
    $stock->location_id = $location->id;
    $stock->quantity = 20;
    $stock->cost = '5.20';
    $stock->reason = 'I bought some';
    $stock->save();
    
So, we've successfully added stock to our inventory item, now let's add some more quantity to it:

    $location = Location::find(1);
    
    $item = Inventory::find(1);
    
    $stock = $item->getStockFromLocation($location);
    
    /*
    * Reason and cost are always optional
    */
    $reason = 'I bought some';
    $cost = '5.20';
    
    /*
    * Remember, you're adding the amount of your metric, in this case Litres
    */
    $stock->put(3, $reason, $cost);
    
    /*
    * Or you can use the add, they both perform the same function
    */
    $stock->add(3, $reason, $cost);
    
We've added quantity to our stock, now lets take some away:

    $reason = 'I drank it';
    
    $stock->take(15, $reason);
    
    /*
    * Or you can use remove, they both perform the same function
    */
    $stock->remove(15, $reason);
    
Actually hang on, we definitely didn't drink that much, let's roll it back:

    $stock->rollback();
    
    /*
    * We can also rollback specific movements, this is recommended 
    * so you know which movement you're rolling back. You may want to
    * rollback the last movement, but if a movement is created during a rollback,
    * it won't take this into account.
    */
    $movement = InventoryStockMovement::find(2);
    
    $stock->rollback($movement);
    
    // Or we can even trigger a rollback on the specific movement:
    
    $movement->rollback();
    
Now that we've added stock to our inventory, and made some changes, all changes are automatically tracked. 
If an exception occurs during a stock change, it is automatically reversed using Laravel's built in database transactions.

If you look at your database, inside your `inventory_stock_movements` table, you should see 4 records:

    | id | stock_id | user_id | before | after | cost | reason |
       1     1           1       0.00    20.00   0.00    
       2     1           1       20.00   23.00   5.20    'I bought some'   
       3     1           1       23.00   8.00    0.00    'I drank it'
       4     1           1       8.00    23.00   0.00    'Rolled back movement ID: 3 on 2015-01-15 10:00:54'

Another situation you might run into, is rolling back a specific movement and reversing all of the movements that
occurred AFTER the inserted movement. This is called a recursive rollback. This is how it's performed:

    $movement = InventoryStockMovement::find(3);
    
    $stock = InventoryStock::find(1);
    
    /*
    * Passing in true to the second argument will rollback all movements that happened after the inserted rollback,
    * including itself.
    */
    $stock->rollback($movement, true);
    
    /*
    * Or on the movement itself:
    */
    $movement->rollback(true);

## Asking Questions

There are some built in 'questions' you can ask your retrieved records. Many more are coming, but for now, here is a list:

####Inventory

    $item = Inventory::find(1);
    
    /*
    * Returns true/false it the total stock of the item is greater than 0
    */
    $item->isInStock();
    
    /*
    * Returns true/false if the item has a metric assigned to it
    */
    $item->hasMetric();
    
    /*
    * Returns true/false if the item has an SKU
    */
    $item->hasSku();

####Stock

    $stock = InventoryStock::find(1);
    
    /*
    * Returns true if the quantity entered is less than or equal to the amount of available stock.
    *
    * This will throw a Stevebauman\Inventory\Exceptions\NotEnoughStockException if there is not enough
    */
    $stock->hasEnoughStock($quantity = 0);
    
    /*
    * Returns true if the quantity entered is a valid quantity for updating the stock with.
    *
    * This will throw a Stevebauman\Inventory\Exceptions\InvalidQuantityException if it is not valid
    */
    $stock->isValidQuantity($quantity);

## SKU Generation

In update `1.1.*`, automatic SKU generation was added, however if you'd like to generate SKU's yourself, you can do so
by disabling it inside the configuration.

### What is an SKU?

From Google:

'Stock Keeping Unit - SKU' A store's or catalog's product and service identification code, often portrayed 
as a machine-readable bar code that helps the item to be tracked for inventory.

### How does inventory create the SKU?

Inventory creates the SKU by grabbing the first 3 (three) characters of the item's category name, and then assigning a
code by using the items ID. For example, an item with the category named 'Drinks' and an item ID of 1 (one), this will be generated:

    DRI00001

Both the prefix and the code are customizable in the configuration file.

The column `code` is bound by a unique constraint on the `inventory_skus` database table to ensure they are
always unique.

### What happens when an inventory item doesn't have a category?

If an inventory item does not have a category, no SKU is generated. Once you assign a category to the inventory, 
it will be automatically generated.

### What happens if the category name is short?

If the categories name is below the number of characters set in the configuration file, then the prefix is just shorter.
For example, an item with a category named 'D', and an item ID of 1 (one), this will be generated:

    D00001
    
A category name needs to be at least 1 (one) character in length to generate a valid SKU.

### How do I get the SKU from an item?

Easy, just ask the item using the laravel accessor:

    $item = Inventory::find(1);
    
    $item->sku_code;
    
Or use the method:

    $item->getSku();

### How do I regenerate an SKU?

Regenerating an SKU will delete the previous items SKU and create another. This is useful if you changed the items category.
You can perform this like so:

    $item = Inventory::find(1);
        
    $item->regenerateSku();

### How do I generate an SKU myself?

First, disable SKU generation in the configuration file, then generate an sku like so:

    $item = Inventory::find(1);
            
    $item->generateSku();

If an item already has an SKU, or SKU generation was successful, it will return the current SKU record.

If an item does not have a category, it will return false.

If SKU generation is disabled, or creating an SKU failed, it will return false.

If the item's category name is blank or empty, it will return false.

### How do I find an item by it's SKU?

Use the method `findBySku($sku = '')` on your inventory model like so:

    $item = Inventory::findBySku('DRI00001');

## Suppliers

In update 1.3 you can now add Suppliers easily to an inventory item.

First we'll create a supplier:

    $supplier = new Supplier;
    
    //Mandatory fields
    $supplier->name = 'Drink Supplier';
    
    //Optional fields
    $supplier->address = '123 Fake Street';
    $supplier->postal_code = 'N8J 2K7';
    $supplier->zip_code = '12345';
    $supplier->country = 'Canada';
    $supplier->region = 'Ontario';
    $supplier->city = 'London';
    $supplier->contact_title = 'Manager';
    $supplier->contact_name = 'John Doe';
    $supplier->contact_phone = '555 555-5555';
    $supplier->contact_fax = '555 555-5555';
    $supplier->contact_email = 'john.doe@email.com';
    
    $supplier->save();
    
Now we can add the supplier to an item using the `Inventory` model helper function `addSupplier($supplier)`:

    $item = Inventory::find(1);
    
    $item->addSupplier($supplier);
    
    //Or we can use the suppliers ID
    $item->addSupplier(1);
    
    //Adding multiple suppliers at once
    $item->addSuppliers(array($supplier));
    
We can also remove suppliers using:

    $item->removeSupplier($supplier);
    
    //Or we can use the suppliers ID
    $item->removeSupplier(1);
    
    //Removing multiple suppliers at once
    $item->removeSuppliers(array($supplier));
    
    //Removing all suppliers from an item
    $item->removeAllSuppliers();

The inverse can also be done on the supplier model:

    $supplier->addItem($item);
    $supplier->addItem(1);
    
    $supplier->addItems(array($item));
    $supplier->addItems(array(1, 2, 3));
    
    $supplier->removeItem($item);
    $supplier->removeItem(1);
    
    $supplier->removeItems(array($item));
    $supplier->removeItems(array(1, 2, 3));
    
    $supplier->removeAllItems();

## Exceptions

Using this inventory system, you have to be prepared to catch exceptions. Of course with Laravel's great built in validation, most of these should not be encountered.

These exceptions exist to safeguard the validity of the inventory.

Here is a list of method's along with their exceptions that they can throw.

### NoUserLoggedInException

Occurs when a user ID cannot be retrieved from Sentry, Sentinel, or built in Auth driver 
(doesn't apply when `allow_no_user` is enabled)

### NotEnoughStockException

Occurs when you're trying to take more stock than available. Use a try/catch block when processing take/remove actions:
    
    try 
    {
        $stock->take($quantity);
        
        return "Successfully removed $quantity";
        
    } catch(Stevebauman\Inventory\Exceptions\NotEnoughStockException)
    {
        return "There wasn't enough stock to perform this action. Please try again.";
    }

### StockAlreadyExistsException

Occurs when a stock of the item already exists at the specified location. Use a try/catch block when processing move actions:

    try
    {
        $stock->moveTo($location);
        
        return "Successfully moved stock to $location->name";
        
    } catch(Stevebauman\Inventory\Exceptions\StockAlreadyExistsException)
    {
        return "Stock already exists at this location. Please try again.";
    }

### InvalidQuantityException

Occurs when a non-numerical value is entered as the quantity, such as `'30L'`, `'a20.0'`. Strings (as long as they're numeric), 
integers and doubles/decimals are always valid. You can use laravel's built in validation to prevent this exception from
occurring, or you can use a try/catch block when processing actions involving quantity:

    try 
    {
        $quantity = '20 Litres'; //This will cause an exception
        
        $stock->add($quantity);
        
        return "Successfully added $quantity";
        
    } catch(Stevebauman\Inventory\Exceptions\InvalidQuantityException)
    {
        return "The quantity you entered is invalid. Please try again.";
    }

### InvalidLocationException

Occurs when a location cannot be found, or the specified location is not a subclass or instance of Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model

### InvalidMovementException

Occurs when a movement cannot be found, or the specified movement is not a subclass or instance of Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model

## Methods & Their Exceptions

#### Inventory Stock Movement Model Methods

    /**
    * @throws InvalidMovementException
    */

## Events

Most inventory operations will trigger events that you are free to do what you please with. Here is a list of methods
and their events:

    /*
    * Triggers 'inventory.sku.generated', the item record is passed into this event. 
    * This is only triggered if the record for the sku is actually created.
    */
    $item->generateSku();
    $item->regenerateSku();

    /*
    * Triggers 'inventory.stock.taken', the stock record is passed into this event
    */
    $item->takeFromLocation($quantity, $location);
    $item->takeFromManyLocations($quantity, $locations = array());
    $item->removeFromLocation($quantity, $location);
    $item->removeFromManyLocations($quantity, $locations = array());
    $stock->take($quantity);
    $stock->remove($quantity);
    
    /*
    * Triggers 'inventory.stock.added', the stock record is passed into this event
    */
    $item->addToLocation($quantity, $location);
    $item->addToManyLocations($quantity, $locations = array());
    $item->putToLocation($quantity, $location);
    $item->putToManyLocations($quantity, $locations = array());
    $stock->put($quantity);
    $stock->add($quantity);
    
    /*
    * Triggers 'inventory.stock.moved', the stock record is passed into this event
    */
    $item->moveStock($fromLocation, $toLocation);
    $stock->moveTo($location);
    
    /*
    * Triggers 'inventory.stock.rollback', the stock record is passed into this event
    */
    $stock->rollback();
    $stock->rollback($movement, $recursive = true);
    $movement->rollback();
    $movement->rollback($recursive = true);

## Auth Integration

Integration with Sentry, Sentinel and Laravel's auth driver is built in, so inventory items, stocks and movements are automatically
tagged to the current logged in user. However, you turn this off if you'd like in the config file under:

    'allow_no_user' => false //Set to true
    
## Misc Functions and Uses

#### Helpful Scopes

######How do I scope an item by it's category and include the results from deeper categories?

Place this inside your `Inventory` model. You can also use this implementation for scoping Locations on the `InventoryStock` model.

    /**
     * Filters inventory results by specified category
     *
     * @return object
     */
    public function scopeCategory($query, $category_id = NULL)
    {
        if ($category_id) {
        
            /*
             * Get descendants and self inventory category nodes
             */
            $categories = $this->category()->find($category_id)->getDescendantsAndSelf();
            
            /*
             * Perform a subquery on main query
             */
            $query->where(function ($query) use ($categories) {
            
                /*
                 * For each category, apply a orWhere query to the subquery
                 */
                foreach ($categories as $category) {
                    $query->orWhere('category_id', $category->id);
                }
                
                return $query;
                
            });
        }
    }
    
Using this will effectively allow you to see all of the inventory from a parent category.

#### Helpful Accessors

######How do I show the last movement for a stock record?

You can simply create 2 Accessors. Place this accessor on the `InventoryStock` model:

    /**
     * Accessor for viewing the last movement of the stock
     *
     * @return null|string
     */
    public function getLastMovementAttribute()
    {
        if ($this->movements->count() > 0) {

            $movement = $this->movements->first();

            if ($movement->after > $movement->before) {

                return sprintf('<b>%s</b> (Stock was added - %s) - <b>Reason:</b> %s', $movement->change, $movement->created_at, $movement->reason);

            } else if ($movement->before > $movement->after) {

                return sprintf('<b>%s</b> (Stock was removed - %s) - <b>Reason:</b> %s', $movement->change, $movement->created_at, $movement->reason);

            }
            else{

                return sprintf('<b>%s</b> (No Change - %s) - <b>Reason:</b> %s', $movement->change, $movement->created_at, $movement->reason);

            }

        }

        return NULL;
    }
    
Place this accessor on the `InventoryStockMovement` model:

    /**
     * Returns the change of a stock
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getChangeAttribute()
    {
        if ($this->before > $this->after) {

            return sprintf('- %s', $this->before - $this->after);

        } else if($this->after > $this->before) {

            return sprintf('+ %s', $this->after - $this->before);

        } else {
            return 'None';
        }
    }
    
Now, inside your view to display stock records you can use:

    @if($stocks->count() > 0)
    
        @foreach($stocks as $stock)
    
            {{ $stock->last_movement }} // Will display in format '+ 20 (Stock was Added) - Reason: Stock check'
    
        @endforeach
    
    @else
        
        There are no stocks to display for this item.
        
    @endif
